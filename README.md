# Zanes TradeMe Car Deal Scraper

Scrapes new TradeMe listings, scores them against historical prices,
and emails the top 5 deals from the latest scrape.

Edit the filters at the top of `scraper.py` (you can add multiple filter sets).

---

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install playwright
python -m playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Configure your email (Gmail recommended)

Gmail requires an **App Password** (your real Gmail password will not work
because of 2FA). Here is how to get one:

1. Go to your Google Account -> **Security**
2. Under "How you sign in to Google", click **2-Step Verification** (enable it if not already)
3. Scroll to the bottom -> **App passwords**
4. Create a new app password (name it "TradeMe Scraper")
5. Copy the 16-character password Google gives you

Rename `config.example.py` to `config.py`, then edit it:

```python
SMTP_HOST = "smtp.gmail.com"
SMTP_PORT = 465

SMTP_USER = "example@gmail.com"
SMTP_PASS = "abcd efgv sfdc pohg"   # app password (spaces are fine)

EMAIL_FROM = "example@gmail.com"
EMAIL_TO   = "example@gmail.com"    # where to receive alerts
```

### 3. Test it manually

```bash
# Just scrape and print results (no email)
python scraper.py

# Send email (after scraping)
python mailer.py
```

## Multiple filter sets

You can scrape multiple filter sets in one run by editing `FILTER_SETS` in `scraper.py`:

```python
FILTER_SETS = [
    {
        "name": "Mercedes C200",
        "make": "mercedes-benz",
        "model": "c-200",
        "year_min": 2010,
        "min_price": None,
        "max_price": 15000,
        "max_kms": 140_000,
        "region_id": None,
    },
    {
        "name": "Toyota Corolla",
        "make": "toyota",
        "model": "corolla",
        "year_min": 2012,
        "min_price": 3000,
        "max_price": 12000,
        "max_kms": 160_000,
        "region_id": 2,
    },
]
```

Each filter set is scraped in sequence and all results are combined into one run.
The database stores listings from all filter sets together, and scoring uses
historical listings that match the same make/model and year window.

## Run it every day automatically

### Windows (Task Scheduler)

1. Open **Task Scheduler** -> Create Basic Task
2. Set trigger: **Daily** at 8:00 AM
3. Action: **Start a program** (create two tasks, 5 minutes apart)
   - Program: `python`
   - Arguments: `scraper.py` (first task)
   - Start in: `C:\path\to\trademe_scraper`
4. Second task:
   - Program: `python`
   - Arguments: `mailer.py` (second task)
   - Start in: `C:\path\to\trademe_scraper`

### Mac / Linux (cron)

Open your crontab:
```bash
crontab -e
```

Add these lines to run every morning at 8am:
```
0 8 * * * cd /path/to/trademe_scraper && python scraper.py >> scraper.log 2>&1
5 8 * * * cd /path/to/trademe_scraper && python mailer.py >> mailer.log 2>&1
```

Replace `/path/to/trademe_scraper` with the actual folder path
(e.g. `/Users/yourname/trademe_scraper`).

## How the deal scoring works

Each new listing is compared to the **median price** of similar cars
(same make, same model, year within ±2 years by default) already in the database.
You can change this with `YEAR_WINDOW` in `scraper.py`.

The database uses WAL mode and an index on `(make, model, year)` for faster
performance as it grows.
The score is **price as a percentage of the median** (lower is better).

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ≤ 80% | Hot deal - priced well below median |
| ≤ 90% | Good deal |
| 90–110% | Near median |
| > 110% | Above median |

**Note:** Scoring improves over time as more listings accumulate in the database.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scraper.py` | Playwright scraper + DB + deal scorer |
| `mailer.py` | Emails the top 5 deals from the latest scrape |
| `config.py` | Your email credentials (local only) |
| `config.example.py` | Template config to copy |
| `trademe_cars.db` | SQLite database (created automatically) |
| `db_view.py` | View recent listings from the database |
| `scraper.log` | Cron output log |
| `mailer.log` | Cron output log |

---

## Troubleshooting

**No listings found / 0 cards scraped**
TradeMe may have updated their HTML structure. Open `scraper.py` and
update the CSS selectors in `scrape_page()`. Use Playwright's
`page.pause()` in headed mode to inspect the live DOM:
```python
browser = await p.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # see the browser
await page.pause()                                  # opens inspector
```

**Blocked / Cloudflare challenge**
- Increase the sleep delays in `scrape_all_pages()`
- Run at off-peak hours (the cron runs at 8am by default - try 3am)
- Reduce `MAX_PAGES` to scrape less

**Email not sending**
- Double-check your App Password in `config.py`
- Make sure 2FA is enabled on your Google account
- Check `mailer.log` for the full error
